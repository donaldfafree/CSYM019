        <h3>CSYM019 - Internet Programming</h3>
        <h4>Lecture: Tom Butler</h4>
        <p>
          This module focuses on creating client and server side software as
          well as web applications for the World Wide Web us. It concentrates on
          the technologies used to allow such software to be designed
          implemented and deployed.

        <h3>CSYM015 - Intelligent Systems</h3>
        <h4>Lecturer: Scott Turner</h4>
        <p>
          To teach students the fundamentals theory and practical applications
          of search methods and agents. The underpining concept will be
          introduced followed by examples of how Intelligent systems are used in
          applications on the Internet.

        <h4>Michael Opoku Agyeman</h4>
        <p>
          This purpose of this module is to consider the structure and behaviour
          of the various functional modules of the computer and how they
          interact to provide the processing needs of the user. This module
          covers systems ranging from PCs through multiprocessors with respect
          to hardware design and instruction set architecture.

        <h3>CSYM030 â€“ Mobile Device Software Development</h3>
        <h4>Espen Svennevik</h4>
        <p>
          This module focuses on creating software for mobile computing devices.
          It concentrates on the necessary technologies used to allow such
          devices to communicate and how to develop software to allow them to do
          so.
